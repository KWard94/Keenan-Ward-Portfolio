# Portfolio Website for Keenan Ward

## This is a website that I built to host my professional portfoio. This site is built with Javascript and React.js. The styling is a mix of Bootstrap and vanilla CSS.

#### At this time the site is fairly basic. I will continue to improve and grow the site

##### Future features and implementations:

- [ ] Add animations to the "enter" link

- [ ] Add a Rock, Paper, Scissors game on the homepage

- [ ] Create interesting scroll features for the projects

- [ ] Add the PDF functionality for the Resume
